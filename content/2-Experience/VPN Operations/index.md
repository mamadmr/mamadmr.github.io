### Technical Infrastructure
Designed and implemented self-managed VPN infrastructure using Nginx proxy server, Xray tunneling, and CDN integration for secure international data routing.

### Key Components
- **Nginx Proxy Configuration:** Configured secure proxy server to route data to main server located outside the country
- **Xray Tunnel Implementation:** Set up advanced tunneling system with SSL certificates for authentication and encrypted communication
- **CDN Integration:** Integrated Content Delivery Network services to optimize speed and reduce latency
- **Reverse Proxy Setup:** Configured Nginx as reverse proxy for secure data routing and SSL certificate management

### Technical Achievements
- **Security Implementation:** Established end-to-end encryption for all data transmission
- **Performance Optimization:** Achieved significant latency reduction through CDN integration and traffic optimization
- **Infrastructure Reliability:** Maintained 99.9% uptime across distributed server network
- **International Connectivity:** Successfully implemented secure data routing infrastructure across international boundaries

### Technologies & Skills
Specialized in server configuration, network security, SSL/TLS implementation, CDN optimization, and distributed system architecture for secure communications infrastructure.

### Architecture Highlights
- Multi-layer security implementation
- Geographic load balancing
- Automated certificate management
- Real-time performance monitoring
